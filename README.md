## Replications
Based on FINA60200 (details below) replications done in Python. Objective is to replicate the same important empirical corporate finance papers, but in Stata to get a working knowledge of the language. 

FINA60200:

This course analyzes the fundamental theories of corporate finance in light of empirical evidence with the aim of understanding the motivations behind financing and investment decisions.

We examine how the characteristics of a company can influence, for example, its choice of optimal capital structure, ownership structure, and risk management policy. We first introduce the basic theoretical concepts and then discuss relevant empirical evidence. In this discussion, we develop an intuition about the challenge of endogeneity and causal inference in empirical research in corporate finance.
